# Native Applications

Native applications utilize Capacitor JS as the base library for handling
generating and deploying native applications to iOS and Android.

This folder contains configurations that abstract capacitor's configurations to
further enhance the flexibility of the deploy capabilities of capacitor.

Here, we can specify capcitor configurations specific to android and ios and for
target environments that follow the app/config environment configurations.

Naming strategy follows:

```
capacitor.config.<environment>.ts
```
