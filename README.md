# Public Devops

This project is a wrapper of the more complex project @vega-studio/node-devops.

This has many of the same commands as that project, but has a reduced version of
helper methods and processes that exists in the vega-studio project.

If you wish to utilize the full toolset, please contact geniant at geniant.com
or one of it's team members for details on the full devops suite.
